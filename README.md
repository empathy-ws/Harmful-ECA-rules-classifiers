# Risky-IFTTT-applets-classifiers

This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "NLP-based Approaches for Identifying Security and Privacy Risks of IFTTT Applets" submitted to Future Generation Computer Systems.

This material comprises the dataset employed to train the classification models and the source codes useful for the repeatability of the experiments.

# Dataset Information

The original dataset [1] (<a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~fengqian/ifttt_measurement/">download</a>) composed of unlabeled applets was partitioned into two sets of data, which were go through two separate processes: while a random small set of applets was manually labeled, the remaining larger set of unlabeled applets managed to be labeled through an automatic process. In fact, we considered three semi-supervised classification models which exploit the set of labeled applets to acquire sufficient knowledge for providing the labels to the applets contained in the larger set. Then, an ensemble approach was employed to establish, among the labels provided by the semi-supervised models, which should be the label to be assigned to each applet, yielding a final large dataset of applets labeled according to the four classes of risk.

# Models Information

We considered two types of classifiers. The first, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), treats discrete features (TriggerTitle, TriggerChannelTitle, ActionTitle, and ActionChannelTitle) as numerical values, using the label encoder technique, and the
continuous features (Title and Desc) as textual values, using a word embedding technique, namely Global Vectors for Word Representation. The second is based on BERT, a pre-training model of natural language processing, which uses deep bidirectional transformers to train a language representation model through a large number of data. For this model, all features were treated as text.
